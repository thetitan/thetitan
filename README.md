# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" height="236" width="181" src="./assets/images/business_n_hat.png" alt="Alexandar T." id="profile-img"/>My name is Alexandar I. Tzanov. You can call me either Alexandar or Al.

I am a full-stack LAMP developer with sys-admin experience. I also have experience working with clients providing software development services as I guide their products through the software development life cycle. In addition, my experience with customers extend also to end users, providing primarily Tier 3 support.

GitHub is home only to some of my projects. My active projects live in repositories on Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. My Cloud experience range from organization/user and billing administration to App Engine, Datastore/Firestore, and Cloud Build on GCP, and VM, MySQL, and App Services on Azure. I have also used cloud functions for deploying custom APIs.

Or, we can connect on LinkedIn ([@thetitan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thetitan/ "Alexandar Tzanov's LinkedIn profile.")). Don't forget to checkout my personal blog called [Titan Fusion](https://www.titanfusion.net/ "Titan Fusion").
