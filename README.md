# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" height="236" width="181" src="./assets/images/business_n_hat.png" alt="Alexandar T." id="profile-img"/>My name is Alexandar I. Tzanov. You can call me either Alexandar or Al.

I am a full-stack LAMP developer with sys-admin experience, ranging from on-premises to Cloud environments like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. My experience include working directly with clients providing software development services as I guide their projects through the software development life cycle, with post-release product and user support.

My resume and full CV can be viewed on my profile website - [AlexandarTzanov.com](https://www.alexandartzanov.com "Alexandar Tzanov's profile website")

GitHub is home only to some of my projects. My active projects live in repositories on Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. My Cloud experience range from organization/user and billing administration to App Engine, Datastore/Firestore, and Cloud Build on GCP, and VM, MySQL, and App Services on Azure. I have also used cloud functions for deploying custom APIs.

We can also link-up on LinkedIn ([@thetitan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thetitan/ "Alexandar Tzanov's LinkedIn profile.")).

Last, but not least, do checkout my personal blog, called [Titan Fusion](https://www.titanfusion.net/ "Titan Fusion"), where I write about movies and games, post how-to articles, and muse about life. The blog version of the website has been around since 2003!
